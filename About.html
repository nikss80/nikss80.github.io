			<h3>About me</h3><!--adds a 3rd header-->
			
			<p>My name is Nikhil Pradhan and i was born in Kathmandu, Nepal on 30th august 1998. I was born and raised in Kathmandu. My parents are Vijay Pradhan and Nilima Pradhan. I have graduated my school and high school from Little Angels Higher Secondary School. My favorite things to do are enjoying music, travelling, photography and painting.<br></p><!--1st paragraph-->
			
			<p>My love for computer stated at an early age. I was always astonished by computers and other technologies. I am quite passionate about learning about computers and how they work. This curiosity in computer machines leads me to study Information Technology in NAMI college. Since then i have enjoyed learning codes and programming. I found programming to be quite fun. while i am not the most active person but i try to works hard and dedicate my time and effort to complete any given task. Being a shy person i dont speak too often. I'd like to think more than i speak.<br> As a developer my aims are to be creative and develop skills to complete any given projects. Improve problem solving and researching skills and increase the efficiency in my work. My short term goal is to double the speed and efficiency of writing codes to create my own software and make it open source so that people can learn, improve and gain skills from it. while my long term goal remains vague, but i would like to be a professional developer and develop large scaling softwares for big company.<br> </p><!--2nd paragraph-->

			<p>I like to go by the quote "no pain no gain". Knowing that career in becoming developer can be pretty tough, but facing and overcoming these tough challenges are satisfying, which is the reason i chose and love programming.  <br></p><!--final paragraph-->
