		<h2>Design choices</h2><!-- creates a header-->
		<p>Nowadays, there are wide variety of website with different design and styles. Different design comes with different level of difficulty. Most people do not enjoy complex website as they can be pretty frustrating at times to use. people having little knowledge about websites tend to never even use the website to its full potential and use the feature that it offers. This is the reason most of people are more inclined towards website which are simple to use and extremely user friendly.<br></p><!--1st paragraph-->
		<p>So there has been increase in the number of simple website. They are mostly influenced by google material design. Website doesn't necessarily have to have bells and whistles such as all the flashy icons, stylish fonts, bright colors et cetera. It can be simple yet appealing as well. For my designing of the website I chose the minimal look as it is the current trending UI. For the color combination, three different color were kept which are eye friendly. They are grey, yellowish orange, and white. Larger header fonts are quite good looking than smaller header which will help to grab peoples attention. The colors of navigation/header and footer and body are kept the same on all the pages to maintain consistency. Also text shadows and box shadows are included to make a hovering like effect. Footer was kept at the center to make it look professional. An image was also added to make the webpage interesting and less boring. Professional social link were kept to make it professional with no icons. Most of the references were taken from google material design. <br> </p><!-- 2nd paragraph-->

		<h2>Experiences of learning web development</h2><!-- 2nd header-->
		<p>On the very first day of web development class, we were taught the ways to use git hub, how to push items in repository et cetera. Then basic html codes were taught. They were extremely easy. Then difficulty of codes increased up after few weeks. we were taught new codes such as flex, float, animation, transitions, color grading, form validations, taglines, comments etc. We were taught the importance of responsive design. The web pages should be optimized because most of the currently users access the website through their phone. Any difficulties in codes were  discussed with module leader and among our friends. Learning to use new codes and observing the result was most satisfying. But debugging the codes was tedious at time as we need to check every single codes line by line. Some time, error was very small like missing taglines, commas semicolons which was quite frustrating at first. The assessment of web given to us was also great because it gave us an opportunity to be creative and come up with our own ideas to create our own personal website. Overall I would say my experience in web development was quite good. I look forward for the course of web development in second term  i enjoyed coding and will continue to do so.</p><!--paragraph-->
